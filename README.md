# tango_with_django_project
Welcome to my university project!

This project revolves around the Tango with Django book which covers Python, Django, web languages like HTML, CSS.

As well as this, some basic database integration is also involved.

This is part of my University of Glasgow WAD2 project. In order to run this program on your own computer, you must install Python 3.9, Django 2.2 and Pillow.

NOTE: This project can be used for reference and reviewing code statements only. It should not be claimed as your own for submission.
